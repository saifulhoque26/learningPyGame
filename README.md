# learningPyGame

This is a small game I made to learn about pygame. Run this game; when you click on the birds, the birds disappear. 

Basically it is to get started with learning about pygame. 

It starts with a background screen, and there are some birds. 

When you click on the birds, they disappear and you get points. 

Thanks.
